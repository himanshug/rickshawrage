============

An Auto-Rickshaw racing game in J2ME. You can see the demo video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO9q-UromWo .


While in college, I wrote this game as an entry to a mobile game dev contest by Sun Microsystems and Paradox Studios. 

In order to run the game, your phone has to support J2ME with CLDC-1.1 and MIDP-2.0. Also, its optimized for the screen size 176 X 208 px

The Build: If you have any interest in rebuilding the game. At the time, when I wrote it, I was not familiar with IDEs/ANT and I simply used Sun Java WTK. So, the easiest way would be to use WTK :).

Disclaimer: Pretty much all the graphics work used in this game was provided by Paradox studios and Sun Microsystems. To the best of my knowledge I'm not violating any copyrights. If someone has any issues with the graphics used in this game, let me know and I'll replace them.
